# API POOL

<p align="center">An open-source repository that provide pool of apis related to almost all use cases to software professionals.</p>

## Description

An open-source repository that provide pool of apis related to almost all use cases to software professionals.

## Project setup

```bash
$ yarn install #(install all dependencies)

$ touch .env #(create .env file, you can take reference from .env-sample file)

$ yarn run start:dev #(start the backend server)
```

## Testing

```bash
$ yarn run test
```

## Deployment

You can deploy the app on any of the linux server of your choice. You can also use deployment tools like caprover, coolify etc to deploy this app.

## Usage

You can use this repository in following ways:-

- You can clone this repository, set up the entire project, and run it locally. The main advantage of this method is that your data will reside on your local machine only, so there's no risk of data loss.
- The second method is to directly consume our live APIs for testing purposes. This method is straightforward and painless; however, the main disadvantage is that we completely reset our databases after one day, so your data will no longer be available afterward.
